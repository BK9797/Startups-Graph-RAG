# 📖 Overview

**Tech / Startups GraphRAG** is a lightweight Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built on top of a **Neo4j Knowledge Graph**.

Instead of asking an LLM to invent database queries, the system first retrieves the most relevant graph entities using **embedding similarity** and **Neo4j Full-Text Search**, builds a graph context, and finally asks **Groq LLM** to generate an answer **grounded only in the retrieved data**.

This architecture provides:

- ⚡ Fast retrieval
- 🎯 Accurate graph-based answers
- 🔒 No hallucinated database queries
- 🧠 Context-aware natural language responses

---

# ✨ Features

- 💬 Natural language question answering
- 🕸️ Neo4j Knowledge Graph backend
- 🔎 Embedding-based entity retrieval
- 📚 Neo4j Full-Text Search fallback
- 🤖 Groq LLM answer synthesis
- 🚀 FastAPI REST API
- 🎨 Interactive Streamlit frontend
- 🧪 Automated testing with Pytest
- ☁️ Ready for Railway deployment

# ⚡ Quick Start

## 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BK9797/Startups-Graph-RAG.git

cd Startups-Graph-RAG
```

---

## 2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv

source .venv/bin/activate      # Linux / macOS

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

## 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 4️⃣ Configure Environment Variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and provide:

```text
NEO4J_URI=
NEO4J_USERNAME=
NEO4J_PASSWORD=
GROQ_API_KEY=
```

---

## 5️⃣ Run the Backend

```bash
make api
```

The API will be available at

```
http://localhost:8000
```

Interactive Swagger documentation:

```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

---

# 🎨 Streamlit Frontend

Launch the interactive interface:

```bash
streamlit run app/frontend/streamlit_app.py
```

The Streamlit application provides an intuitive chat interface for querying the graph using natural language.

---

# 🧪 Run Tests

Execute the complete test suite:

```bash
make test
```

---

# 💬 Example API Request

```json
{
    "question": "Who founded NovaPay?"
}
```

---

# ✅ Example Response

```json
{
    "answer": "NovaPay was founded by Elena Rossi in 2016.",
    "template_id": "embedding"
}
```

# 📌 Key Design Decisions

### 🔹 Embedding-First Retrieval

The system first retrieves semantically similar entities using vector embeddings before falling back to Neo4j Full-Text Search.

### 🔹 Grounded Generation

Groq receives **only the retrieved graph context**, ensuring responses remain faithful to the underlying knowledge graph.

### 🔹 Lightweight Graph Context

Only the most relevant nodes and relationships are included in the prompt, keeping responses fast and reducing unnecessary context.

### 🔹 No LLM-Generated Cypher

The language model never writes Cypher queries or directly interacts with the database.

# 🚀 Future Improvements

- Hybrid Vector + Graph Retrieval
- Conversation Memory
- Multi-hop Graph Reasoning
- Graph Visualization
- Docker Support
- Authentication & Authorization
- Advanced Ranking Algorithms
